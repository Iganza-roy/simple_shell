# SIMPLE_SHELL

This project is a custom shell built in C. The shell displays a prompt, waits for the user to type a command, and executes the command. It handles simple, single-word commands without advanced features like semicolons, pipes, or redirections. If an executable cannot be found, an error message is printed, and the prompt is displayed again.
